long_description: |
  This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify kidney disease from medical images. It includes a binary classifier to identify kidney CT scans and a multi-class classifier to differentiate types of kidney diseases, such as cysts, stones, tumors, or normal conditions. The backend is built with FastAPI and containerized using Docker, while the frontend, developed with Next.js, provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.
